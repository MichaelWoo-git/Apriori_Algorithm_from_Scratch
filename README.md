#### Implementation
* Using the concept of sets, counters, dataframes, and lambdas, loops, and well defined functions to carry out specific tasks that captures the implemention of the Apriori Algorithm from scratch. 

## Running Aprior_Algo.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)

##### Make sure to run the ENTIRE workbook
